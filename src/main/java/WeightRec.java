/*	WeightRec.java	When we have to pick out the most important terms by means of weights	we calculate the smallest Salton weight for each, and create a WeightRec	for each to store the weight itself and the original index of the entry	because sorting will obviously change the order of the terms.*/public class WeightRec		// 24/7/98 at 14:48{	private int		fIndex;	private double		fWeight;	int	GetIndex()	{ return fIndex; }	double	GetWeight()	{ return fWeight; }	/*******************************************************************************		WeightRec::WeightRec	*******************************************************************************/	public WeightRec( int index, double weight)	{		fIndex = index;		fWeight = weight;	}}
